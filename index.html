        <h3>About Me...</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Greg De Leon and I really love to code.
            Since my first code experience I realized that this
            career choice would have been a great second choice
            if I ever had to do it all again in college. 
            After getting my first job as a Controls Engineer I
            realized the parts of the job I loved the most were the
            coding challenged that I would give myself. Thus, why I
            am here turning a new leaf and hoping for a positive experience.
